# Efficient Phonebook Searching and Sorting

## Description
Developed by Yusuf Erkam Köksal for CS300 Homework 5, this project implements an efficient phonebook search and sorting system using various algorithms. It demonstrates the use of Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort for sorting contacts, and Binary and Sequential Search for finding specific entries.

## Features
- Importing contact data from a file into a vector.
- Implementing Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort for sorting contact data.
- Using Binary Search for efficient searching in sorted data.
- Employing Sequential Search for unsorted data.
- Performance measurement for each sorting and searching algorithm.

## Usage
1. **Compile the Program**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler.
2. **Run the Executable**: The program will prompt for the filename containing contact data and the search query.
3. **Observe Sorting and Searching**: The program will display the time taken by each sorting and searching algorithm.

### Example Usage

Enter the file name:
[datafile.txt]
Please enter the word to be queried:
[Search Query]


## Installation
No additional libraries are required for this project. It relies on standard C++ libraries.

## Note
- The project is a demonstration of the efficiency of different sorting and searching algorithms in managing phonebook data.
- The time taken for each operation is measured and displayed, providing insights into the performance of each algorithm.
