# Phonebook Management System with BST and Hash Table

## Description
This project, developed by Yusuf Erkam Köksal for CS300 Homework 4, implements a phonebook management system using a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Hash Table. It offers efficient storage, retrieval, and management of contact information.

## Features
- Efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations using BST and Hash Table.
- Capability to load contact information from a file.
- Rehashing mechanism in the Hash Table to maintain load factor.
- Performance measurement of operations in both BST and Hash Table.

## Usage
1. **Compile the Program**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler.
2. **Run the Executable**: Follow the prompts to perform various operations:
   - Search for a contact.
   - Add a new contact.
   - Delete a contact.
   - Exit the program.

### Example Usage

Choose which action to perform from 1 to 4:
1 - Search a phonebook contact
2 - Adding a phonebook contact
3 - Deleting a phonebook contact
4 - Exit


## Installation
No additional libraries are required for this project. It uses standard C++ libraries and headers.

## Note
- The project demonstrates the efficiency of BST and Hash Table in handling phonebook data.
- Load factor and rehashing are key aspects of the Hash Table's performance.
- The program is interactive and prompts the user for input.
